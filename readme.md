# Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc - Webpage

## Description
Webpage rework for OSU bootcamp challenge 1. Webpage was broken when I first got the project. There were links that were broken, CSS and HTML elements that weren't being used or were being used incorrectly. I was able to clean up and fix a lot of the problems and had a little fun along the way. Semantic elements are now being used to make finding code easier in the future. The webpage should now be easier to maintain as well as being more accessible to everyone.
